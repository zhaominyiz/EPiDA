## :fire: 2. Quick Start :fire:
Suppose you have already get a dataset, you can modify the code in train_sst_epida_eda.py or train_irony_epida_eda.py for quick start.
```
python3 train_irony_epida_eda.py
```

## :beers: Data Access :beers:

The SST dataset can be achieved via [SUB2](https://home.ttic.edu/~freda/paper/shi2021substructure.pdf).

The corpus used in major paper can be downloaded by checking the links given in the paper or email.
